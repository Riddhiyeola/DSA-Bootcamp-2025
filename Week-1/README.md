# Welcome to Week 1
Welcome to the first week of our DSA Bootcamp 2025! This week, we’ll start by equipping ourselves with a solid understanding of Time Complexity, which is essential for writing efficient code and analyzing the performance of algorithms. Following this, we’ll delve into foundational data structures like Arrays and Strings, which are crucial for solving a wide range of programming problems.

Also, we'll practise on many problems to test our understanding and strengthen our problem-solving skills.

Stay engaged and practice consistently to make the most of this learning experience. Keep your enthusiasm high, and let’s begin this exciting journey into Data Structures and Algorithms together!

1. First start with reading about **Time Complexity**, a key concept that helps us evaluate the efficiency of our code and algorithms.
2. Our first data structure will be **Arrays**, which allow us to store and access data efficiently.
3. Next, we'll explore **Strings**, which are fundamental for manipulating and processing textual data.
4. While learning Arrays and Strings, we’ll also solve problems side by side to apply concepts and improve our coding skills.
